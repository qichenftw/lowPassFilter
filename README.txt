Low Pass Filter

A C implementation of a low pass filter. An ideal low-pass filter takes
an input signal, completely attenuates its components above the cutoff
frequency, and passes everything below the cutoff frequency as its output
signal.


Parts:

main.c – This file contains the main function which reads in the inputs.
plot.py – This is a python script that enables visualization of the input signal
          against the calculated output signal.


To compile the code, use the following command:

gcc –Wall –g main.c –o mp3 –lm

To run program:
./mp3 > myoutone
